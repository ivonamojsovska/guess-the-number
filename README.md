# Guess The Number

 Guess the Number is a simple game where the user is prompted to guess a randomly generated number. The game has been created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Content

When the game starts, the user is informed about the range of numbers they have to guess from. They are then asked to input their guess. If the guess is incorrect, the game informs the user whether the guess is too high or too low, and prompts them to guess again. The game continues in this manner until the user correctly guesses the number.

The game includes several features, such as a limit on the number of guesses the user can make, an option to replay the game, and a scoreboard that keeps track of the user's high score.

### Instalation
